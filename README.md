## Key Features & UI/UX Improvements

This redesign introduces significant improvements over the original design, focusing on user confidence and a frictionless journey.

- **Modern Two-Column Layout**: The cluttered grid has been replaced with a clean, intuitive two-column layout. This separates the primary action (selecting a size) from the detailed information, reducing cognitive load for the user.

- **Fully Responsive Design**: The interface seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes.
  - **Desktop**: A spacious two-column view.
  - **Mobile**: A single-column layout with the selected skip's image displayed prominently at the top and a mobile-native sticky CTA bar at the bottom for constant access to the primary action.
